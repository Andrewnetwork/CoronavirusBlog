PROMETHEUS:<br/>
MONARCH of Gods and DÃ¦mons, and all Spirits<br/>
But One, who throng those bright and rolling worlds<br/>
Which Thou and I alone of living things<br/>
Behold with sleepless eyes! regard this Earth<br/>
Made multitudinous with thy slaves, whom thou<br/>
Requitest for knee-worship, prayer, and praise,<br/>
And toil, and hecatombs of broken hearts,<br/>
With fear and self-contempt and barren hope;<br/>
Whilst me, who am thy foe, eyeless in hate,<br/>
Hast thou made reign and triumph, to thy scorn,  <br/>  
O'er mine own misery and thy vain revenge.<br/>
</div>
<div style="font-size:13px; margin-right:4%;">  
Three thousand years of sleep-unsheltered hours,<br/>
And moments aye divided by keen pangs<br/>
Till they seemed years, torture and solitude,<br/>
Scorn and despair--these are mine empire:<br/>
More glorious far than that which thou surveyest<br/>
From thine unenvied throne, O Mighty God!<br/>
Almighty, had I deigned to share the shame<br/>
Of thine ill tyranny, and hung not here<br/>
Nailed to this wall of eagle-baffling mountain,<br/>            
Black, wintry, dead, unmeasured; without herb,<br/>
Insect, or beast, or shape or sound of life.<br/>
Ah me! alas, pain, pain ever, forever!<br/>

This is a world of burdens: who is free here? As I discuss in ["Man and The Question Put to Him,"](man_and_his_question.md) our burdens are a blessing in disguise: they are our worldly anchor which keeps us from drifting into the abyss of existential terror that awaits the *unmorred*. Given our worldly constraints, we easily forget, or never experience, how *strange* existence is. To bound men, life is simply a matter of satisfying the multitude of expectations imposed on them. If you attempt to reflect on the *strangeness* of existence with them, they will say *you* are the only strange thing that has crossed their path! 

Perhaps it is *strange* to consider existence *strange*. When we say something is strange, we mean that it is a deviation from the norm. Given that we have never known anything other than our existence, how can one experience a sense of deviating from it? Such a feeling is characteristically metaphysical. Why do I feel that my existence is strange, but gravity is not? We've been conditioned since birth to accept that it is perfectly natural for objects to fall to the ground when we drop them. It certainly feels strange to say that the laws of physics *could* be different. Things *could* fall up instead of down, but then our whole physical reality would change. If matter repels matter instead of matter attracting matter, as it does in our universe, then such a universe wouldn't be able to produce complex amalgamations like us... but this reasoning is from within our world, not from another would where the natural law may be completely bizarre to us.

When we attempt to imagine different laws of physics, we can't escape trying to imagine different laws in terms of the laws we experience. We can imagine things going up instead of down, but we cannot imagine things moving in a way we've never seen before. Our existence, our thoughts, are restricted to a set of elementary objects which we may combine as our will desires, but we can never escape the foundation we are stationed upon -- or so it seems. Thus, any attempt to imagine a different reality is fraudulent: we cannot imagine things being *different*, we can only imagine them being a distortion of what we know, i.e., a transformation of the familiar into the *strange*. 

Things that are different cannot be transformed into each other. The number $2$ is different from my cat because there is no transformation which can transform $2$ into my cat. $2$ is unequal to $1$, but it is not *different* because $1+1=2$ and $2-1=1$, i.e., they can be transformed into each other. There is no way to produce something other than a number by adding numbers together. Likewise, when we try to imagine realities different from our own by performing operations on our conception of reality, the result will always be an object of our reality. 

Perhaps *strange* isn't that strange at all. A deviation from the norm is less severe than an object that cannot even be compared to a norm, i.e., the incomprehensible. Naturally, we have never known anything truly incomprehensible. We may look at writing in a language we do not understand, but we know that it is writing in a language we do not understand, i.e., we can comprehend our incomprehension. By my capacity for reason, I know there must be things incomprehensible to me, but by the virtue of what they are, I know that I cannot even be aware of them. Such objects can be considered to belong to senses we do not possess and are therefore nonsense, i.e., invisible. 

Can you imagine a green pinch on your skin? To those of us without a tactile-color sense, such a sense-object is nonsensical, i.e., nothing enters our mind upon hearing it. There are poetic *abuses* one can think of; they emerge from our mixed sense of what "pinch" and "green" means. "Green" is sometimes used as a synonym for "new" or "fresh." Thus, a "green pinch" can be interpreted as a "fresh pinch," which can further be interpreted as a "sharp pinch." This poetic line doesn't make sense of anything: it takes us even *further* away from sense. Poetic *confusion* may always enter our mind upon hearing nonsense and we are always at risk of interpreting it as legitimate sense. "A green pinch" is nonsense and anything that can be used to convince us otherwise, as seen above, is an enemy of reason. 

The apparent aimlessness of existence could be the cause of feeling the strangeness of existence. The sole objective of the brain is survival, but we cannot survive in the long of time. To be born into a self defeating frame; to be forced to play a game we cannot win; but at the same time, to feel a passionate desire for victory and survival. Maybe the feeling of strangeness is borne out of the many contradictions we embody; maybe the competing forces within us are what creates the space which allows us to sense the absurdity of it all. 

Aimlessness is the answer to a question being asked; an answer cannot exist without the question. The apparent aimlessness of existence can only be perceived within contexts where individuals are pursuing meaning. Is it natural for man to pursue meaning, or is it a cultural inheritance? Most men across the ages simply wanted to have sex and eat food. In the context of such aspirations, what does the pursuit of meaning mean? What is the reward of pursuing meaning? To the religious, the pursuit of meaning means the pursuit of uniting with God, i.e., eternal preservation. To academics, the pursuit of meaning means acquiring deep knowledge of a field which leads to publishing influential research papers, i.e., an unknowingly futile attempt at eternal preservation. The pursuit of meaning seems to be code for "looking for a way out," i.e., seeking a way to cheat death...to be preserved, oh how much we long to be preserved!  

Another possible explanation for feeling the strangeness of existence is the interplay between our conscious and subconscious mind. Our consciousness rests upon an immensely complicated biological machine that we can only make use of indirectly. I may send the "move my hand" command down from my conscious mind into my body and it is magically done for me: how it is achieved is not an object I can reflect on with my consciousness. Much is inaccessible to our consciousness and this is perhaps the biological basis for feeling that we are in some sort of strange and mysterious world. Our own minds were designed to trick us in various ways for the benefit of survival. Our species didn't evolve in the cradle of academia, where the potency of one's capacity for investigation is the measure of survival fitness.

Is feeling the strangeness of existence *pathological* or can it be derived from first principles? Given that humans seem to be the only species of its type, i.e., we do not know of any creatures which possess a linguistic capacity similar to our own, and that we seem to be of a fundamentally different character than most of the inert matter in the observable universe, then we may argue that our existence is strange on the basis of our rarity. Rare objects may be interpreted in two ways: spectacular or strange. Strangeness means an *undesirable* deviation from the norm and spectacular means a *desirable* deviation from the norm. We may interpret existence in both ways: as a confused experience or a fantastical experience. Therefore, feeling the strangeness of existence cannot be said to be a direct product of us knowing that we are rare objects because *strangeness* is a particular interpretation of this knowledge.

The modern world most likely also contributes to feeling the strangeness of existence. We did not evolve in an environment with computers, electricity internet, T.V., artificial intelligence, etc. Perhaps feeling the strangeness of existence is a response to this *strange* environment we have created for ourselves. Which group is more likely to feel the strangeness of existence: aimless T.V. watching westerners or tribal indigenous people? From what I have observed of indigenous peoples, they are typically dumb and happy -- by our standards. The horrors of the modern world and history do not plague their thoughts. They don't know the violent history of the human race; they don't know about biological warfare; they don't know about the atomic bomb; they don't know about intercontinental missiles; they don't know about the threat of artificial intelligence and technological slavery. Even if you told them about these things, they wouldn't be able to comprehend them as we do. If you told them we have bombs capable of destroying everything within miles, they would blink and wonder why on earth would one want to do such a thing; they have never felt the desire to annihilate to such an extreme order of magnitude, but modern men certainly have. A knowledge of our history is the only thing that makes sense of the atomic bomb. Ever since man discovered that he could smash people over the head with a rock, all races have engaged in continual genocide and mass murder -- under the noble name of *war* of course. Only when our barbarism stands revealed by history can you understand why the atomic bomb is useful to such a bloodthirsty beast. I truly envy primitive people's ignorance and ability to forget. We moderns are full of resentment reaching back thousands of years: we do not forgive nor forget. Perhaps the primitives are the only ones capable of remaining sane; we are certainly stark raving mad by comparison.
