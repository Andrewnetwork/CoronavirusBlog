PROMETHEUS:<br/>
MONARCH of Gods and DÃ¦mons, and all Spirits<br/>
But One, who throng those bright and rolling worlds<br/>
Which Thou and I alone of living things<br/>
Behold with sleepless eyes! regard this Earth<br/>
Made multitudinous with thy slaves, whom thou<br/>
Requitest for knee-worship, prayer, and praise,<br/>
And toil, and hecatombs of broken hearts,<br/>
With fear and self-contempt and barren hope;<br/>
Whilst me, who am thy foe, eyeless in hate,<br/>
Hast thou made reign and triumph, to thy scorn,  <br/>  
O'er mine own misery and thy vain revenge.<br/>
</div>
<div style="font-size:13px; margin-right:4%;">  
Three thousand years of sleep-unsheltered hours,<br/>
And moments aye divided by keen pangs<br/>
Till they seemed years, torture and solitude,<br/>
Scorn and despair--these are mine empire:<br/>
More glorious far than that which thou surveyest<br/>
From thine unenvied throne, O Mighty God!<br/>
Almighty, had I deigned to share the shame<br/>
Of thine ill tyranny, and hung not here<br/>
Nailed to this wall of eagle-baffling mountain,<br/>            
Black, wintry, dead, unmeasured; without herb,<br/>
Insect, or beast, or shape or sound of life.<br/>
Ah me! alas, pain, pain ever, forever!<br/>

This is a world of burdens: who is free here? As I discuss in ["Man and The Question Put to Him,"](man_and_his_question.md) our burdens are a blessing in disguise: they are our worldly anchor which keeps us from drifting into the abyss of existential terror that awaits the *unmorred*. Given our worldly constraints, we easily forget, or never experience, how *strange* existence is. To bound men, life is simply a matter of satisfying the multitude of expectations imposed on them. If you attempt to reflect on the *strangeness* of existence with them, they will say *you* are the only strange thing that has crossed their path! 

Perhaps it is *strange* to consider existence *strange*. When we say something is strange, we mean that it is a deviation from the norm. Given that we have never known anything other than our existence, how can one experience a sense of deviating from it? Such a feeling is characteristically metaphysical. Why do I feel that my existence is strange, but gravity is not? We've been conditioned since birth to accept that it is perfectly natural for objects to fall to the ground when we drop them. It certainly feels strange to say that the laws of physics *could* be different. Things *could* fall up instead of down, but then our whole physical reality would change. If matter repels matter instead of matter attracting matter, as it does in our universe, then such a universe wouldn't be able to produce complex amalgamations like us... but this reasoning is from within our world, not from another would where the natural law may be completely bizarre to us.

When we attempt to imagine different laws of physics, we can't escape trying to imagine different laws in terms of the laws we experience. We can imagine things going up instead of down, but we cannot imagine things moving in a way we've never seen before. Our existence, our thoughts, are restricted to a set of elementary objects which we may combine as our will desires, but we can never escape the foundation we are stationed upon -- or so it seems. Thus, any attempt to imagine a different reality is fraudulent: we cannot imagine things being *different*, we can only imagine them being a distortion of what we know, i.e., a transformation of the familiar into the *strange*. 

Things that are different cannot be transformed into each other. The number $2$ is different from my cat because there is no transformation which can transform $2$ into my cat. $2$ is unequal to $1$, but it is not *different* because $1+1=2$ and $2-1=1$, i.e., they can be transformed into each other. There is no way to produce something other than a number by adding numbers together. Likewise, when we try to imagine realities different from our own by performing operations on our conception of reality, the result will always be an object of our reality. 

Perhaps *strange* isn't that strange at all. A deviation from the norm is less severe than an object that cannot even be compared to a norm, i.e., the incomprehensible. Naturally, we have never known anything truly incomprehensible. We may look at writing in a language we do not understand, but we know that it is writing in a language we do not understand, i.e., we can comprehend our incomprehension. By my capacity for reason, I know there must be things incomprehensible to me, but by the virtue of what they are, I know that I cannot even be aware of them. Such objects can be considered to belong to senses we do not possess and are therefore nonsense, i.e., invisible. 

Can you imagine a green pinch on your skin? To those of us without a tactile-color sense, such a sense-object is nonsensical, i.e., nothing enters our mind upon hearing it. There are poetic *abuses* one can think of, but they emerge from our mixed sense of what "pinch" and "green" means. "Green" is sometimes used as a synonym for "new" or "fresh." Thus, a "green pinch" could be interpreted as a "fresh pinch," which could further be interpreted as a "sharp pinch." This poetic line doesn't make sense of anything: it takes us even *further* away from sense. Poetic *confusion* may always enter our mind upon hearing nonsense and we are always at risk of interpreting it as legitimate sense. "A green pinch" is nonsense and anything that can be used to convince us otherwise, as seen above, is an enemy of reason.
