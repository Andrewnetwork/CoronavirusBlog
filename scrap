The following nine points form the basis of my spiritual understanding of life and I will attempt to make a case for life from them. 

>1.) That which is moved by time is material. 
2.) That domain of material is the universe. 
3.) That which is unmoved by time is spirit. 
4.) The domain of spirit is God. 
5.) Man is the union of material and spirit. 
6.) Truth is spirit in time. 
7.) The word of God is truth. 
8.) Man knows God by loving his word. 
9.) The sole will of God is for man to know God.    `


**(1 and 2)** We live in a world that is constantly changing. We know that if we leave something in one place, the nature of the universe insists that it will be moved and eventually destroyed, i.e., transformed into something else. For much of human history, this is all man knew of his world. 

**(3 and 4)** Then, at some point, man discovered *truth*: objects that cannot be destroyed by time. Objects of truth are of a completely different character than the objects man was accustomed to handling with his hands: such objects could only be held by his mind. Consider a number and how it stands in relation to physical objects. I can have one apple, one horse, one bride, etc. The property of *oneness* describes states of affairs in the world, but also simultaneously remains apart from the world. If you destroy *one* apple, you don't destroy the Idea of *one*: it exists independent of all states of affairs in the world that can be said to have this property. Upon realizing this property of truth, man began to equate truth with God; for God has always represented that which cannot be destroyed. 

**(5)** Man is a creature of the universe, i.e., he can be destroyed by time, but he can also unite with objects that cannot be destroyed by time: he has the capacity to know truth. Thus, man is not merely a material object, nor is he an object of truth: man is a union of material and spirit. By knowing truth and using it in the world, we become representations of the eternal in the universe. This is the case for man's divinity and his high station in the universe. Offenses against man are not merely offenses against material objects; they are also offenses against the eternity represented by him, i.e., an offense against God. 

**(6)** When spirit enters time, it becomes a truth. `2+2=4` is a truth. I have used time to represent a spirit, i.e., a higher object that exists outside of time -- which we may call the spirit of the truth. All over the world people may be using this truth in various contexts, i.e., the spirit of this truth is being used to modify objects in time. In platonism, the word *Idea* is used instead of spirit. My distinction in terms rests upon the fact that we have an interface to timeless objects. The interface is truth, the object as the thing-in-itself is spirit. 

**(7)** A word is an object that calls forth associations when spoken or read. What object but truth calls forth that which is eternal? Thus, the word of God is truth. 

> He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.
> 
> -John 4:8

**(8)** Can love come without knowing? What is the relation between knowing and love? When we love someone, they become a part of us. Knowing is the mechanism by which we embrace others and truths. Thus, to know God, we must love his word, i.e., unite with truth. 

**(9)** Man cannot survive without the application of truth to the world. Unlike beasts, man is ill-suited to survive on earth without using his ability to understand the world, i.e., to apply truth to it. By man's very design, he was destined to discover truth in order to survive.
