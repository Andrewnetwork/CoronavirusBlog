The following nine points form the basis of my spiritual understanding of life and I will attempt to make a case for life from them. 

>1.) That which is moved by time is material. 
2.) That domain of material is the universe. 
3.) That which is unmoved by time is spirit. 
4.) The domain of spirit is God. 
5.) Man is the union of material and spirit. 
6.) Truth is spirit in time. 
7.) The word of God is truth. 
8.) Man knows God by loving his word. 
9.) The sole will of God is for man to know God.    `


**(1 and 2)** We live in a world that is constantly changing. We know that if we leave something in one place, the nature of the universe insists that it will be moved and eventually destroyed, i.e., transformed into something else. For much of human history, this is all man knew of his world. 

**(3 and 4)** Then, at some point, man discovered *truth*: objects that cannot be destroyed by time. Objects of truth are of a completely different character than the objects man was accustomed to handling with his hands: such objects could only be held by his mind. Consider a number and how it stands in relation to physical objects. I can have one apple, one horse, one bride, etc. The property of *oneness* describes states of affairs in the world, but also simultaneously remains apart from the world. If you destroy *one* apple, you don't destroy the Idea of *one*: it exists independent of all states of affairs in the world that can be said to have this property. Upon realizing this property of truth, man began to equate truth with God; for God has always represented that which cannot be destroyed. 

**(5)** Man is a creature of the universe, i.e., he can be destroyed by time, but he can also unite with objects that cannot be destroyed by time: he has the capacity to know truth. Thus, man is not merely a material object, nor is he an object of truth: man is a union of material and spirit. By knowing truth and using it in the world, we become representations of the eternal in the universe. This is the case for man's divinity and his high station in the universe. Offenses against man are not merely offenses against material objects; they are also offenses against the eternity represented by him, i.e., an offense against God. 

**(6)** When spirit enters time, it becomes a truth. `2+2=4` is a truth. I have used time to represent a spirit, i.e., a higher object that exists outside of time -- which we may call the spirit of the truth. All over the world people may be using this truth in various contexts, i.e., the spirit of this truth is being used to modify objects in time. In platonism, the word *Idea* is used instead of spirit. My distinction in terms rests upon the fact that we have an interface to timeless objects. The interface is truth, the object as the thing-in-itself is spirit. 

**(7)** A word is an object that calls forth associations when spoken or read. What object but truth calls forth that which is eternal? Thus, the word of God is truth. 

> He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.
> 
> -John 4:8

**(8)** Can love come without knowing? What is the relation between knowing and love? When we love someone, they become a part of us. Knowing is the mechanism by which we embrace others and truths. Thus, to know God, we must love his word, i.e., unite with truth. 

**(9)** Man cannot survive without the application of truth to the world. Unlike beasts, man is ill-suited to survive on earth without using his ability to understand the world, i.e., to apply truth to it. By man's very design, he was destined to discover truth in order to survive. 


> I TEACH YOU THE SUPERMAN. Man is something that shall be overcome. What have you done to overcome him? All beings thus far have created something beyond themselves: and do you want to be the ebb of that great tide, to return to the beast rather than overcome man? What is the ape to man? A laughing-stock, a thing of shame. And man shall be that to the Superman: a laughing-stock, a painful embarrassment. You have made your way from  worm to man, but much of you is still worm. Once we were apes, and even now too man is more ape than any ape. Even the wisest among you is only a disharmony and hybrid of plant and phantom. But do I bid you become phantoms or plants? Lo, I teach you the Superman! The Superman is the meaning of the earth. Let your will say: The Superman SHALL BE the meaning of the earth!

>-Friedrich Nietzsche, "Thus Spake Zarathustra"

The meaning of life to the faithful is to serve the will of God. Nietzsche notoriously rejected religion and the faith in God. To Nietzsche, in my interpretation of him, men of faith see life as a trial for rewards one receives in the afterlife; and by doing this, Nietzsche calls them nihilists, i.e., deniers of life. The meaning of life to Nietzsche, as preached by his Zarathustra in "Thus Spake Zarathustra," is to overcome man. Strangely, I interpret Christianity, a recurring target of his diatribes against nihilism, as sharing this same goal. Does Christianity preach a return to our basest nature? On the contrary, it preaches that man is of a divine source and thus the meaning of life should be to unite with our higher nature, i.e., with God. Given that many men of faith have advanced our species in their pursuit of knowing God, i.e., truth, how can it be said that faith in God is a life-denying act which calls for us to return to our basest nature and not overcome man? 

Nietzsche seems to have strictly equated Christians with those who are chiefly concerned with moral integrity, i.e., the medieval Christians, but surely he was aware of the enlightenment Christians who pushed the boundaries of man's understanding further than it had ever been before. I will not speculate on why Nietzsche did this, but the fact that he seems to have done this warrants skepticism of his attacks on Christianity. 

Perhaps Nietzsche wasn't aware of the *trick*, i.e., that the faith in God allows us to know things that we otherwise couldn't because our brains refuse to confront certain truths without a replacement for material survival. He dismissed religion, God, and called their adherents decadents: those who retreat into self-indulgent fantasies because they are too afraid to know the truth. While this can certainly be said of some of the faithful, it cannot be said of them all: the faith in God has motivated man across many ages to seek higher truths about our world, i.e., to overcome man.
