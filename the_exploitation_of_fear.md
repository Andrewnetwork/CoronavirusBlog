> How much truth does a spirit endure, how much truth does it dare? More and more that became for me the real measure of value. Error (faith in the ideal) is not blindness, error is cowardice.

If the brain has any secrets, where would they be hidden? Perhaps in the last place we dare to look. In this essay, I reflect on the nature of fear, the games the brain plays when confronting fear, and how the knowledge of such is used against those who are ignorant of such matters. 

# Brain-Blindness 
I am keenly aware that death is not a pleasant subject to address directly, but we must not shy away from our fate if we wish to bravely look at ourselves as we truly are. As I have addressed in ["Man and The Question Put to Him"](man_and_his_question.md), we are not hopelessly stranded with our fate: there is *a way out*. Understanding the survival strategy outlined in that essay, beyond what can be expressed in words, i.e., by putting it into practice, is perhaps the sole reason why I can write about death without experiencing a psychological breakdown, and I suspect a similar faith in God, i.e., a mechanism of eternal preservation, is required to broach the subject in general. 

Have you ever looked over a cliff and thought about jumping, not in a suicidal way, but simply imagined jumping? The French call this *l'appel du vide*, i.e., *the call of the void*. This particular phenomenon is a fantastic example of how the brain uses imagination to *comprehend* potential actions and dangers in our environment. Our brian actually does this all the time, but we are so accustomed to this behavior that we do not take special notice of it; in ordinary cases, we simply call it *thinking*. In the case of *the call of the void*, our inclination to imagine in order to comprehend stands out because we imagine our death or grievous injury and it seems like a strange unhealthy behavior of the brain to the brain; thus, we take special notice of it because it appears to be an *error*, which could itself be a threat to the brain: are we mentally defective and at risk of jumping off cliffs? 

All men have experienced imagining themselves romancing a woman they are attracted to -- *the call of the loins*. Are *the call of the void* and *the call of the loins* not one and the same phenomenon? Given that they are, why then does *the call of the void* attract special attention, while *the call of the loins* is rarely given special notice? In the case of the former, we imagine bad things happening to us and the brain does not like imagining bad things happening to us! In the case of the latter, we imagine good things happening to us and the brain loves *fantasy*! Thus, by juxtaposing *the call of the void* and *the call of the loins*, we observe the quintessential bias of the brain: the brain favors imagining good outcomes for itself over poor outcomes and can even go as far as to deem imagining poor outcomes as a malady! 

If one approaches the subject of death ill-equipped, the brain will not engage with the subject: one remains brain-blind. Experientially, brain-blindness in an unstimulated imagination which prohibits one from grasping what is before them. Therefore, in order to comprehend matters pertaining to death, we must condition our brains in a way that allows them to *see*, i.e., imagine, what is before them. Our minds are like a society -- as Minsky argues in "The Society of Mind." Our seemingly despotic reign over our minds is an illusion: we do not have as much control over our minds as we are wont to believe, but at the same time, we have *more* control than is readily imagined. It all comes down to *how* we control our minds. Just like a leader of a society, if one properly engineers the incentives of his subordinates, the society will flourish and become much greater than the sum of its parts; however, if a leader eschews incentive engineering and instead imposes direct tyrannical control over his subordinates, a society will become a mere extension of him and the diversity that makes a society robust will not emerge and hence become much poorer as a result. Thus, we must guide our minds after the fashion of great leaders: we must use the power we have over our minds to set the conditions for certain thoughts to emerge rather than forcefully attempting to bring them about. 

Now, we must ask: how does one condition the brain so that it isn't blind before matters pertaining to death? A description of the solution is possible, but I do not know how to describe a rigorous procedure which constructs the solution, i.e., a state of mind which allows one to confront death and its subordinate phenomena. The solution is the faith in God or something isomorphic to God, i.e., faith in eternal preservation. The entire industry of religion is dedicated to this purpose. The many rituals of religions around the world *are* the means by which they condition the individual to confront death. The seemingly strange conclusion is: in order to confront death, one must believe in preservation apart from the material world, i.e., preservation of the spirit. This *trick*, which I mean no disrespect to any religion by calling it such, of conditioning the brain to believe in spiritual preservation is what one must use to confront material death. If you want to break a bad habit, you must create an incentive which allows you to change your behavior to pursue ends coupled to different rewards. In this sense, in order to go *beyond* the doorway of death, we must create an incentive which allows the brain to go beyond it. What else but the faith in God, i.e., faith in spiritual preservation, serves this function? Is this not the *secret power* of religion?  

# The Origin of Fear
> I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.

>-Frank Herbert, "Dune"

Oblivion is the destiny of our flesh, it is the destiny of the flesh of our flesh, and it is the destiny of our earthly name which binds flesh to our spirit. The sole objective of the brain is self-preservation: everything it does is a means to the end of avoiding our fate. Fear is the product of our fate looming near: all that which reminds us of oblivion or brings us closer to it induces terror and all that which keeps it at a distance brings us comfort. Therefore, the principle of all motion regulated by the brain can be described as oblivion avoidance strategy. Knowing *the* game being played by the brain, i.e., the manifold interpretations of survival, is highly advantageous to those who seek to exploit brain behavior for their own purposes. 

If you were offered the chance of comfortably retreating to a cabin in the woods for the remainder of your life, where all your basic needs are met in isolation, would you seize the opportunity?
