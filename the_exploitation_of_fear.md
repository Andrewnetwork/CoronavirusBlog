If the brain has secrets, where would they be hidden? Perhaps in the last place we dare look. In this essay, I reflect on the nature of fear, the brain's natural aversion to confronting the origin of fear, and how the knowledge of such is used to capture man's soul. 

## Brain-Blindness, Self-Preservation Strategy, and Faith in God

I am keenly aware that death is not a pleasant subject to address directly, but we must not shy away from our fate if we wish to bravely look at ourselves as we truly are. As I have addressed in ["Man and The Question Put to Him"](man_and_his_question.md), we are not hopelessly stranded with our fate: there is *a way out*. Understanding the survival strategy outlined in that essay, beyond what can be expressed in words, i.e., by putting it into practice, is perhaps the sole reason why I can write about death without experiencing some sort of psychological breakdown. The faith in God, i.e., a mechanism of eternal preservation, is required to broach the subject of death because our brains are designed to avoid undermining its sole objective of self-preservation. One may certainly utter the word "death," but the mind does not produce the full vision of the *oblivion* it entails unless it is properly conditioned to do so. 

Have you ever looked over a cliff and thought about jumping, not in a suicidal way, but simply imagined jumping? The French call this *l'appel du vide*, i.e., *the call of the void*. This particular phenomenon is a fantastic example of how the brain uses imagination to *comprehend* potential actions and dangers in our environment. Our brian actually does this all the time, but we are so accustomed to this behavior that we do not take special notice of it; in ordinary cases, we simply call it *thinking*. In the case of *the call of the void*, our inclination to imagine in order to comprehend stands out because we imagine our death or grievous injury and it seems like a strange unhealthy behavior of the brain *to the brain*; thus, we take special notice of it because it appears to be an *error*, which could itself be a threat to the brain: are we mentally defective and at risk of jumping off cliffs? 

All men have experienced imagining themselves romancing a woman they are attracted to -- *the call of the loins*. Are *the call of the void* and *the call of the loins* not one and the same phenomenon? Given that they are, why then does *the call of the void* attract special attention, while *the call of the loins* is rarely given special notice? In the case of the former, we imagine bad things happening to us and the brain does not like imagining bad things happening to us! In the case of the latter, we imagine good things happening to us and the brain loves *fantasy*! Thus, by juxtaposing *the call of the void* and *the call of the loins*, we observe the quintessential bias of the brain: the brain favors imagining good outcomes for itself over poor outcomes and can even go as far as to deem imagining poor outcomes as a malady! 

If one approaches the subject of death ill-equipped, the brain will not engage with the subject: one remains brain-blind. Experientially, brain-blindness in an unstimulated imagination which prohibits one from grasping what is before them. Therefore, in order to comprehend matters pertaining to death, we must condition our brains in a way that allows us to *see*, i.e., imagine, what is before us. Our minds are like a society -- as Minsky argues in "The Society of Mind." Our seemingly despotic reign over our minds is an illusion: we do not have as much control over our minds as we are wont to believe, but at the same time, we have *more* control than is readily imagined. It all comes down to *how* we control our minds. Just like a leader of a society, if one properly engineers the incentives of his subordinates, the society will flourish and become much greater than the sum of its parts; however, if a leader eschews incentive engineering and instead imposes direct tyrannical control over his subordinates, a society will become a mere extension of him and the diversity that makes a society robust will not emerge and hence become much poorer as a result. Thus, we must guide our minds after the fashion of great leaders: we must use the power we have over our minds to set the conditions for certain thoughts to emerge rather than forcefully attempting to bring them about. 

Now, we must ask: how does one condition the brain so that it isn't blind before matters pertaining to death? A description of the solution is possible, but I do not know how to describe a rigorous procedure which constructs the solution, i.e., a state of mind which allows one to confront death and its subordinate phenomena. The solution is the faith in God or something isomorphic to God, i.e., faith in eternal preservation. The entire industry of religion is dedicated to this purpose. The many rituals of religions around the world *are* the means by which they condition the individual to confront death. The seemingly strange conclusion is: in order to confront death, one must believe in preservation apart from the material world, i.e., preservation of the spirit. This *trick*, which I mean no disrespect to any religion by calling it such, of conditioning the brain to believe in spiritual preservation is what one must use to confront material death. If you want to break a bad habit, you must create an incentive which allows you to change your behavior to pursue ends coupled to different rewards. In this sense, in order to go *beyond* the doorway of death, we must create an incentive which allows the brain to go beyond it. What else but the faith in God, i.e., faith in spiritual preservation, serves this function? Is this not the *secret power* of religion? 

## The Origin and Exploitation of Fear
> I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.

>-Frank Herbert, "Dune"

Oblivion is the destiny of our flesh, it is the destiny of the flesh of our flesh, and it is the destiny of our earthly name which binds flesh to our spirit. The sole objective of the brain is self-preservation: everything it does is a means to the end of avoiding our fate. Fear is the product of our fate looming near: all that which reminds us of oblivion, or brings us closer to it, induces terror and all that which keeps it at a distance brings us comfort. Therefore, the principle of all motion regulated by the brain can be described as oblivion avoidance strategy. Knowing *the* game being played by the brain, i.e., the manifold interpretations of survival, is highly advantageous to those who seek to exploit brain behavior for their own purposes. 

If you were offered the chance of comfortably retreating to an isolated cabin in the woods for the remainder of your life, would you seize the opportunity? For most people, this would be a sort of living death. If a tree falls in the forest, and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound? If you are living in an isolated cabin in the woods, and no one is around to know you, are you alive? Being *observed* is something most of us desire. Why isn't living enough for us? Why do we feel that it is *crucial* for others to know of our works and of our lives? At this point, many would offer the superficial answer "We're social creatures.", but what insight does such a dogmatic response reveal? Is our social nature an axiom which cannot be deduced from more elementary truths about ourselves? 

When others know us, are we not preserved in their memories? When you reflect on your loved ones, are you not, in some sense, breathing life into a representation of them? Our desire to be *observed* is an extension of our desire to be preserved. In hours of great loneliness, do we not feel as if we are withering away? When we are disconnected from others, we do not have the comfort of being preserved in the minds of others and our only solemn companion remains: oblivion softly breathes on us and the withering we feel is the fear of its eventual *bite*. 

I've spent so many hours with oblivion that I have even come to enjoy its company; I know it will never abandon me and that everything I can learn in life, I can learn from it. Only when you fear oblivion is it an enemy, a great source of fear, the adversary of our lives; however, once you believe oblivion can only consume your name on earth, not your spirit, I assure you that it becomes quite friendly and even its dreadful *bite* becomes a *kiss*. Would you rather live forever? Is it not the greatest kindness that we may rest after our long journey in life? What would life be without an end? The boundary of our existence is what separates us from the forces of nature; it allows us to be an event in time, something apart from the ebb and flow of natural forces. 

There is something so beautiful about a long examined life. We enter the world so distant in understanding, yet full of tremendous rambunctious spirit. In time, aspects of the world begin to call us by resonating with our spirit and we are thereby given a path to uniting with truths beyond ourselves, and to see ourselves illuminated by those truths. We experience the *joy* of knowing things for the first time. To feel truth upon our virgin ignorance... is there a greater experience in life? Then, as representations of truth in the flesh, we slowly creep to our sunset where we are forever preserved in what we *became*. 

We are innately aware that preservation and *being* are related in some way, but the relation itself seems to be our primary task to discover. What one becomes is how one seeks to be preserved. Given this simply stated, yet profound truth about ourselves, along with our desire to be observed, we now can state the most powerful exploitation of fear: the binding of being to observable positions that are useful to those with power over the binding.

In our society, we have several states of being bound to observable positions: artists, scientists, writers, journalists, doctors, lawyers, business leaders, etc. The desire to hold such positions is chiefly driven by economic necessity, but resolving the fear of remaining unpreserved is what truly motivates individuals to pursue such positions. If no one knew or respected you for becoming a doctor, what would motivate an individual to pursue such a grueling position in society? Having nice possessions only goes so far: material gains do nothing to abate our fate of oblivion. Holding such positions allows individuals to feel as if they have preserved themselves by becoming something of value, i.e., something worthy of observation. The systems that control the various positions in our society stand between man and his desire to be preserved. If you control the mechanisms by which man preserves himself, then you control the man: you capture his soul. 

I am not strictly speaking of the state, although the state does have a heavier hand in more industries than it once did, but of all systems that position themselves between man and his desire to be preserved. This is a philosophical essay, and I have no wish to venture into politics; I am merely interested in the existential themes pertaining to the structure of society in general. It is a dreadful property of the way we choose to organize ourselves that so many souls are pressured to become something of value to misanthropic entities, but not necessarily to themselves, in order to feel as if they have achieved preservation -- a tremendous lie. 

The capacity for preservation is within the reach of every man and it does not lie in the demands society makes upon him. The great tragedy is that most men are tricked into becoming things in the pursuit of preservation which actually destroy them. The great exploitation of fear blinds them from the true mechanism of self-preservation: the pursuit of truth, i.e., unity with God. This, of all things, must be the greatest sin of the way we organize ourselves: it only works because men are kept blind from the truth, i.e., they are lead to believe that becoming *something* in the world is their sole means of preservation and are lead away from the pursuit of truth to the pursuit of praise, things, money, and other vulgarities which destroy the soul of man by binding it to material things which must be, by the nature of the material world, destroyed.
