If the brain has secrets, where would they be hidden? Perhaps in the last place we dare look. In this essay, I reflect on the nature of fear, the games the brain plays when confronting fear, and how the knowledge of such is used against those who are ignorant of such matters. 

## Brain-Blindness, Self-Preservation Strategy, and Faith in God
> They are not free to know: the decadents need the lie -- it is one of the conditions of their preservation.

>-Friedrich Nietzsche, "Ecce Homo"

I am keenly aware that death is not a pleasant subject to address directly, but we must not shy away from our fate if we wish to bravely look at ourselves as we truly are. As I have addressed in ["Man and The Question Put to Him"](man_and_his_question.md), we are not hopelessly stranded with our fate: there is *a way out*. Understanding the survival strategy outlined in that essay, beyond what can be expressed in words, i.e., by putting it into practice, is perhaps the sole reason why I can write about death without experiencing a psychological breakdown, and I suspect a similar faith in God, i.e., a mechanism of eternal preservation, is required to broach the subject in general. 

Have you ever looked over a cliff and thought about jumping, not in a suicidal way, but simply imagined jumping? The French call this *l'appel du vide*, i.e., *the call of the void*. This particular phenomenon is a fantastic example of how the brain uses imagination to *comprehend* potential actions and dangers in our environment. Our brian actually does this all the time, but we are so accustomed to this behavior that we do not take special notice of it; in ordinary cases, we simply call it *thinking*. In the case of *the call of the void*, our inclination to imagine in order to comprehend stands out because we imagine our death or grievous injury and it seems like a strange unhealthy behavior of the brain *to the brain*; thus, we take special notice of it because it appears to be an *error*, which could itself be a threat to the brain: are we mentally defective and at risk of jumping off cliffs? 

All men have experienced imagining themselves romancing a woman they are attracted to -- *the call of the loins*. Are *the call of the void* and *the call of the loins* not one and the same phenomenon? Given that they are, why then does *the call of the void* attract special attention, while *the call of the loins* is rarely given special notice? In the case of the former, we imagine bad things happening to us and the brain does not like imagining bad things happening to us! In the case of the latter, we imagine good things happening to us and the brain loves *fantasy*! Thus, by juxtaposing *the call of the void* and *the call of the loins*, we observe the quintessential bias of the brain: the brain favors imagining good outcomes for itself over poor outcomes and can even go as far as to deem imagining poor outcomes as a malady! 

If one approaches the subject of death ill-equipped, the brain will not engage with the subject: one remains brain-blind. Experientially, brain-blindness in an unstimulated imagination which prohibits one from grasping what is before them. Therefore, in order to comprehend matters pertaining to death, we must condition our brains in a way that allows us to *see*, i.e., imagine, what is before us. Our minds are like a society -- as Minsky argues in "The Society of Mind." Our seemingly despotic reign over our minds is an illusion: we do not have as much control over our minds as we are wont to believe, but at the same time, we have *more* control than is readily imagined. It all comes down to *how* we control our minds. Just like a leader of a society, if one properly engineers the incentives of his subordinates, the society will flourish and become much greater than the sum of its parts; however, if a leader eschews incentive engineering and instead imposes direct tyrannical control over his subordinates, a society will become a mere extension of him and the diversity that makes a society robust will not emerge and hence become much poorer as a result. Thus, we must guide our minds after the fashion of great leaders: we must use the power we have over our minds to set the conditions for certain thoughts to emerge rather than forcefully attempting to bring them about. 

Now, we must ask: how does one condition the brain so that it isn't blind before matters pertaining to death? A description of the solution is possible, but I do not know how to describe a rigorous procedure which constructs the solution, i.e., a state of mind which allows one to confront death and its subordinate phenomena. The solution is the faith in God or something isomorphic to God, i.e., faith in eternal preservation. The entire industry of religion is dedicated to this purpose. The many rituals of religions around the world *are* the means by which they condition the individual to confront death. The seemingly strange conclusion is: in order to confront death, one must believe in preservation apart from the material world, i.e., preservation of the spirit. This *trick*, which I mean no disrespect to any religion by calling it such, of conditioning the brain to believe in spiritual preservation is what one must use to confront material death. If you want to break a bad habit, you must create an incentive which allows you to change your behavior to pursue ends coupled to different rewards. In this sense, in order to go *beyond* the doorway of death, we must create an incentive which allows the brain to go beyond it. What else but the faith in God, i.e., faith in spiritual preservation, serves this function? Is this not the *secret power* of religion? 

> I TEACH YOU THE SUPERMAN. Man is something that shall be overcome. What have you done to overcome him? All beings thus far have created something beyond themselves: and do you want to be the ebb of that great tide, to return to the beast rather than overcome man? What is the ape to man? A laughing-stock, a thing of shame. And man shall be that to the Superman: a laughing-stock, a painful embarrassment. You have made your way from  worm to man, but much of you is still worm. Once we were apes, and even now too man is more ape than any ape. Even the wisest among you is only a disharmony and hybrid of plant and phantom. But do I bid you become phantoms or plants? Lo, I teach you the Superman! The Superman is the meaning of the earth. Let your will say: The Superman SHALL BE the meaning of the earth!

>-Friedrich Nietzsche, "Thus Spake Zarathustra"

The meaning of life to the faithful is to serve the will of God. Nietzsche notoriously rejected religion and the faith in God. To Nietzsche, in my interpretation of him, men of faith see life as a trial for rewards one receives in the afterlife; and by doing this, Nietzsche calls them nihilists, i.e., deniers of life. The meaning of life to Nietzsche, as preached by his Zarathustra in "Thus Spake Zarathustra," is to overcome man. Strangely, I interpret Christianity, a recurring target of his diatribes against nihilism, as sharing this same goal. Does Christianity preach a return to our basest nature? On the contrary, it preaches that man is of a divine source and thus the meaning of life should be to unite with our higher nature, i.e., with God. Given that many men of faith have advanced our species in their pursuit of knowing God, i.e., truth, how can it be said that faith in God is a life-denying act which calls for us to return to our basest nature and not overcome man? 

Nietzsche seems to have strictly equated Christians with those who are chiefly concerned with moral integrity, i.e., the medieval Christians, but surely he was aware of the enlightenment Christians who pushed the boundaries of man's understanding further than it had ever been before. I will not speculate on why Nietzsche did this, but the fact that he seems to have done this warrants skepticism of his attacks on Christianity. 

Perhaps Nietzsche wasn't aware of the *trick*, i.e., that the faith in God allows us to know things that we otherwise couldn't because our brains refuse to confront certain truths without a replacement for material survival. He dismissed religion, God, and called its adherents decadents: those who retreat into self-indulgent fantasies because they are too afraid to know the truth. While this can certainly be said of some of the faithful, it cannot be said of them all: the faith in God has motivated man across many ages to seek higher truths about our world. 

## The Origin and Exploitation of Fear
> I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.

>-Frank Herbert, "Dune"

Oblivion is the destiny of our flesh, it is the destiny of the flesh of our flesh, and it is the destiny of our earthly name which binds flesh to our spirit. The sole objective of the brain is self-preservation: everything it does is a means to the end of avoiding our fate. Fear is the product of our fate looming near: all that which reminds us of oblivion, or brings us closer to it, induces terror and all that which keeps it at a distance brings us comfort. Therefore, the principle of all motion regulated by the brain can be described as oblivion avoidance strategy. Knowing *the* game being played by the brain, i.e., the manifold interpretations of survival, is highly advantageous to those who seek to exploit brain behavior for their own purposes. 

If you were offered the chance of comfortably retreating to an isolated cabin in the woods for the remainder of your life, would you seize the opportunity? For most people, this would be a sort of living death. If a tree falls in the forest, and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound? If you are living in an isolated cabin in the woods, and no one is around to know you, are you alive? Being observed is something most of us desire. Why isn't living enough for us? Why do we feel that it is crucial for others to know of our works and of our lives? At this point, many would offer the superficial answer "We're social creatures.", but what insight does such a dogmatic response reveal? Is our social nature an axiom that cannot be deduced from more elementary truths about ourselves? 

When others know us, are we not preserved in their memories? When you reflect on your loved ones, are you not, in some sense, breathing life into a representation of them? Our desire to be *observed* is an extension of our desire to be preserved. In hours of great loneliness, do we not feel as if we are withering away? When we are disconnected from others, we do not have the comfort of being preserved in the minds of others and our only solemn companion remains: oblivion softly breathes on us and we fear its eventual *bite*. 

I've spent so many hours with oblivion that I have even come to enjoy its company; I know it will never abandon me and that all the things I can learn in life, I can learn from it. Only when you fear oblivion is it an enemy, a great source of fear, the adversary of our lives; however, once you accept that oblivion is your only assured companion upon this earth, I assure you that it becomes quite friendly and even its dreadful *bite* becomes a *kiss*. Would you rather live forever? Is it not the greatest kindness that we may rest after our long journey in life? What would life be without an end? The boundary of our existence is what separates us from the forces of nature; it allows us to be an event in time, something apart from the ebb and flow of natural forces. 

There is something so beautiful about a long examined life. We enter the world so distant in understanding, yet full of tremendous rambunctious spirit. In time, aspects of the world begin to call us by resonating with our spirit and we are given a path to uniting with truths beyond ourselves, and to see ourselves illuminated by those truths. We experience the *joy* of knowing things for the first time. To feel truth upon our virgin ignorance... is there a greater experience in life? Then, as representations of truth in the flesh, we slowly creep to our sunset where we are forever preserved in what we *became*. 

We are innately aware that preservation and *being* are related in some way, but the relation itself seems to be our primary task to discover. What one becomes is how one seeks to be preserved. Given this simply stated, yet profound truth about ourselves, along with our desire to be observed, we now can state the most powerful exploitation of fear: the binding of being to observable positions that are useful to those with power over the binding.

In our society, we have several states of being bound to observable positions: artists, scientists, writers, journalists, doctors, lawyers, business leaders, programmers, investors, soldiers, priests, politicians, tradesmen, architects, teachers, etc. The desire to hold such positions is chiefly driven by economic necessity, but resolving the fear of remaining unpreserved is what truly motivates individuals to pursue such positions. If no one knew or respected you for becoming a doctor, what would motivate an individual to pursue such a grueling position in society? Having nice possessions only goes so far: material gains do nothing to abate our fate of oblivion. Holding such positions allows individuals to feel as if they have preserved themselves by becoming something of value, i.e., something worthy of observation. The systems that control the various positions in our society stand between man and his desire to be preserved. If you control the mechanisms by which man preserves himself, then you control the man: you capture his soul. 

I am not strictly speaking of the state, although the state does have a heavier hand in more industries than it once did, but of all systems that position themselves between man and his desire to be preserved. This is a philosophical essay, and I have no wish to venture into politics; I am merely interested in the existential themes pertaining to the structure of society in general. It is a dreadful property of the way we choose to organize ourselves that so many souls are pressured to become something of value to large entities, but not necessarily to themselves, in order to feel as if they have achieved preservation -- a tremendous lie. I think it was the hope of us all that technology would lead to the ringing in of a freer world where more men are given the freedom to become what they wish to become, but alas, things seem to be going in the opposite direction.

Freedom is the freedom to decide what one wishes to become, and what one becomes should never be coupled to the ends of others unless that is what one wishes. I am not saying that every man should have the right to become a CEO. What I am saying is that no man should be inclined to believe that he *must* become a CEO or become *nothing*. In other words: we all should be aware of the magic tricks used to shape the lives of people into pawns in some greater soul's game. 

The capacity for preservation is within the reach of every man and it does not lie in the demands society makes upon him. The tragedy is that many men are tricked into becoming things that do not only not preserve them, but destroy them. The great exploitation of fear blinds them from the true mechanism of self-preservation: the pursuit of truth, i.e., unity with God. This, of all things, must be the greatest sin of the way we organize ourselves: it only works because men are kept blind from the truth, i.e., they are lead to believe that becoming something in the world is the sole means of their preservation and are lead away from the pursuit of truth into the pursuit of things and other vulgarities which destroy the soul of men.
