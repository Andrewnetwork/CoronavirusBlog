If God exists, why is the world full of pain and suffering? Such statements are often included in cases made against the existence of God, but what would the world look like without pain and suffering? Is an assured existence of bliss for all mankind a blessing or a curse? Should the elimination of pain and suffering be our goal as a species? 

What does man become in the absence of pain and suffering? Many cases for examination are scattered upon the earth and throughout history: in the absence of pain and suffering, man becomes a destructive overindulging beast who remains obsessed with pursuits of ever higher delights. Without pain and suffering, man becomes a *drooling* creature.
