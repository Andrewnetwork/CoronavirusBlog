> **Miranda to Caliban:** Abhorrèd slave,<br/>
Which any print of goodness wilt not take,<br/>
Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee,<br/>
Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour<br/>
One thing or other. When thou didst not, savage,<br/>
Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like<br/>
A thing most brutish, I endowed thy purposes<br/>
With words that made them known. But thy vile race,<br/>
Though thou didst learn, had that in ’t which good natures<br/>
Could not abide to be with. Therefore wast thou<br/>
Deservedly confined into this rock,<br/>
Who hadst deserved more than a prison.
