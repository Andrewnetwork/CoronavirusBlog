PROMETHEUS:<br/>
MONARCH of Gods and DÃ¦mons, and all Spirits<br/>
But One, who throng those bright and rolling worlds<br/>
Which Thou and I alone of living things<br/>
Behold with sleepless eyes! regard this Earth<br/>
Made multitudinous with thy slaves, whom thou<br/>
Requitest for knee-worship, prayer, and praise,<br/>
And toil, and hecatombs of broken hearts,<br/>
With fear and self-contempt and barren hope;<br/>
Whilst me, who am thy foe, eyeless in hate,<br/>
Hast thou made reign and triumph, to thy scorn,  <br/>  
O'er mine own misery and thy vain revenge.<br/>
</div>
<div style="font-size:11px; margin-right:20px;">          
Three thousand years of sleep-unsheltered hours,<br/>
And moments aye divided by keen pangs<br/>
Till they seemed years, torture and solitude,<br/>
Scorn and despair--these are mine empire:<br/>
More glorious far than that which thou surveyest<br/>
From thine unenvied throne, O Mighty God!<br/>
Almighty, had I deigned to share the shame<br/>
Of thine ill tyranny, and hung not here<br/>
Nailed to this wall of eagle-baffling mountain,<br/>            
Black, wintry, dead, unmeasured; without herb,<br/>
Insect, or beast, or shape or sound of life.<br/>
Ah me! alas, pain, pain ever, forever!<br/>

This is a world of burdens: who is free here? As I discuss in ["Man and The Question Put to Him,"](man_and_his_question.md) our burdens are a blessing in disguise: they are our worldly anchor which keeps us from drifting into the abyss of existential terror that awaits the *unmorred*. Given our worldly constraints, we easily forget, or never experience, how *strange* existence is. To bound men, life is simply a matter of satisfying the multitude of expectations imposed on them. If you attempt to reflect on the *strangeness* of existence with them, they will say *you* are the only strange thing that has crossed their path! 

Perhaps it is *strange* to consider existence *strange*. When we say something is strange, we mean that it is a deviation from the norm.
