# The Pursuit of Principles
#### Andrew Ribeiro 
#### May 2020

> Indeed, I often wondered why, as far as the recorded history of mankind extends, no mortal had approached such a project, for meditations of this kind ought to be among the first to occur to those **reasoning in the proper order**, just as they occured to me. I came to this discovery while still a youth, for the sole reason that **I always searched for first principles**. The real reason why people have missed the doorway [into this discovery], is, I think, because principles are, for the most part, dry and insufficiently agreeable to people, and so, barely tasted, they are dismissed."
