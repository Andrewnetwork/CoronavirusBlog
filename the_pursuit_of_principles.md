# The Pursuit of Principles - WORK IN PROGRESS

> Indeed, I often wondered why, as far as the recorded history of mankind extends, no mortal had [attempted to assign to all things a characteristic number and thereby reduce reason to a form of arithmetic], for meditations of this kind ought to be among the first to occur to those **reasoning in the proper order**, just as they occurred to me. I came to this discovery while still a youth, for the sole reason that **I always searched for first principles**. The real reason why people have missed the doorway [into this discovery], is, I think, because principles are, for the most part, dry and insufficiently agreeable to people, and so, **barely tasted**, they are dismissed."

If we equate philosophy with "the pursuit of truth," then it follows that the method by which we pursue truth should be the primary object of our studies. If our task was to circumnavigate the globe, setting off on foot wouldn't be a sufficient course of action because we'd never complete our task with such meager means of transportation; it is thus necessary to first study the ways in which man may traverse the earth and thereby develop a method which allows us to complete our journey. The same reasoning can be applied to the pursuit of truth: we are in dire need of methods which assist our minds in traversing the space of truth.

For much of history, man has been lead astray from the pursuit of truth by various kinds of *mysticism*. All mysticism can be characterized by a lack of *demonstrations*. An example of a *mystical proposition* would be: "Putting salt around the windows and doors of your house keeps bad spirits out." The *truth* of such mystical propositions are said to be derived from higher planes of knowledge, or entities which gift such knowledge, and therefore only intersect this world through conduits of supernatural individuals; hence, we cannot possibly prove mystical propositions by worldly demonstrations because they are not of this world... or so the reasoning goes.

Without a mechanism of ensuring that man is in fact traversing the realm of truth, it is easy for him to lose himself in fantastical mythos. Adding the constraint that knowledge must be demonstrable, either by experiment or deduction from first principles, changes the character of the pursuit of truth entirely because it greatly constrains what constitutes truth, i.e., truth becomes *that which can be demonstrated*. 

As I discuss in ["Truth, Construction, and Confusion"](truth_construction_confusion.md), principles can be considered to be that which forms the basis of systems in which objects are constructed; for example, suppose you witness a girl slap a boy, you may say this situation is a demonstration of the principle of anger. Principles are revealed by demonstrations, i.e., constructions, which encompass the *sense* of principles; without demonstrations, principles are nonsensical, i.e., we can *barely taste* them. For example, the theorems of Euclidean geometry form the *sense* of Euclidean geometry, i.e., they are elucidations of the principles, i.e., the axioms and postulates, of Euclidean geometry.

Under the constraint of demonstrable knowledge, the pursuit of truth becomes the pursuit of principles. This poses a significant problem: given that in the absence of demonstrations principles are nonsensical, how does one discover that which is nonsensical? Luckily for us, the universe naturally provides us with many demonstrations
