# The Pursuit of Principles

> Indeed, I often wondered why, as far as the recorded history of mankind extends, no mortal had [attempted to assign to all things a characteristic number and thereby reduce reason to a form of arithmetic], for meditations of this kind ought to be among the first to occur to those **reasoning in the proper order**, just as they occurred to me. I came to this discovery while still a youth, for the sole reason that **I always searched for first principles**. The real reason why people have missed the doorway [into this discovery], is, I think, because principles are, for the most part, dry and insufficiently agreeable to people, and so, barely tasted, they are dismissed."

If we equate philosophy with "the pursuit of truth," then it follows that the method by which we pursue truth should be the primary object of our studies. If our task is to circumnavigate the globe, setting off on foot wouldn't be a sufficient course of action because we'd never complete our task with such meager means of transport; it is necessary to first study the ways in which man may traverse the earth and thereby develop a method which allows us to complete our journey. The same reasoning can be applied to the pursuit of truth: we are in dire need of methods which assist our minds in traversing the space of truth.

For much of history, man has been lead astray from the pursuit of truth by various kinds of *mysticism*. All mysticism can be characterized by a lack of *demonstrations*. An example of a mystical proposition would be: "Putting salt around the windows and doors of your house keeps bad spirits out." The *truth* of such mystical propositions are said to be derived from higher planes of knowledge, or entities which gift such knowledge, and therefore only intersect this world through the conduit of chosen individuals; hence, we cannot possibly prove mystical propositions by worldly demonstrations because they do not of this world... or so the reasoning goes.
