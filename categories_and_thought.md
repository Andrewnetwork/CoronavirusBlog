# Categories and Thought - Work in progress

The world is full of many *things* all mixed up together. A fundamental application of our minds to the problem of comprehending the world is that of classification: separating things into classes. In this essay, I explore the concept of categories and how it relates to thinking.  

## Section 1: Organizing Phenomena

The world appears to contain many things. One of the fundamental mental operations we can perform on things is separate them into groups, i.e., classes. Things seem to be related to other things. The simplest relationship between things is the groups they mutually belong to, i.e., their mutual classifications. *Categories* are the largest mutually exclusive groups of things.

The ten classic Aristotelian categories of things which supposedly have no overlap, i.e., the things in each category are *contained* by that category, i.e., no thing exists in more than one of the categories. 

When we look at a person, their appearance causes us to think of them as "humans," i.e., we experience them as an instance of the human class.  




In *"Critique of Pure Reason,"* Kant describes *phenomena* to be: "appearances to the extent that as objects they are thought in accordance with the unity of the categories."
