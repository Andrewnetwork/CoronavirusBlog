# Categories and Thought - Work in progress

The world is full of many *things* mixed up together. A fundamental application of our minds to the problem of comprehending the world is separating things into groups, i.e., *categories*. In this essay, I explore the philosophical concept of categories and how it relates to the nature of thought.  

## Section 1: Organizing Phenomena

The world appears to contain many things.

In recognition of the perceptual layer between us and the world that contains the *things-in-themselves*, the presentations of appearances in the world are called *phenomena*, i.e., objects of our experience.  

<u><b>(Definition 1) <i>Phenomenon</i>:</b></u> In *"Critique of Pure Reason,"* Kant describes *phenomena* to be: "appearances to the extent that as objects they are thought in accordance with the unity of the categories." 

Phenomena seem to be related to other phenomena. One of the fundamental mental operations we can perform on phenomena is their separation into groups. The simplest relationship between phenomena is the groups they mutually belong to, i.e., their mutual classifications. 

<u><b>(Definition 2) <i>Class</i>:</b></u> A named grouping of phenomena.   

I say classes are "groupings" instead of "groups" to emphasize that the *substance* of classes is the rules by which phenomena are identified as instances of classes, i.e., the mechanisms of *classification*.

How can we discriminate between humans and integers? Note that we are using the *class* name of phenomena, which means this question asks how we discriminate between the grouping mechanism of the human and integer classes. In other words, this is not a question of how the visual representations of humans and integers are discriminated, i.e., image classification.

The simplest way of discriminating between two classes is to ask what can be said about one class that cannot be said about the other. For example, we can say two numbers can be added, but not that two men can be added. The question mark in *Figure 2* indicates that its not clear what can be said of both humans and integers, if anything. If we were asked what can be said of both apples and oranges, we could say they are both fruits, they are both edible, etc. Apples and oranges are *fundamentally* more alike than humans and integers. 

<u><b>(Definition 3) <i>Category</i>:</b></u> *Categories* are the largest mutually exclusive classes. Objects belonging to mutually exclusive classes have no characteristics in common, i.e., what can be said of objects from one class cannot be said of the other.

*Figure 3* depicts the ten original Aristotelian categories[1]. According to these categories, apples, oranges, belong to the *substance* category, and integers belong to the *quantity* category. Thus, the reason why apples and oranges seem fundamentally more alike than humans and integers is that apples and oranges belong to the same category, while humans and integers do not.

What do questions like *Figure 4* make sense to us?
