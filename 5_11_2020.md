> Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster. And if you gaze long enough into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you.

>-Friedrich Nietzsche, "Beyond Good and Evil"


Aristotle believed rationality separates man from beast. In all my observations of beasts, I have never witnessed a display of irrationality. On the contrary, beasts seem to embody the principle of rationality: they act on their basic needs and do no more than this. Can the same be said of man?

It is not enough for us to live in balance with nature, as do beasts who gracefully go with the ebb and flow of life: we strive to harness nature and bend it to our will, i.e., to overcome nature itself. By creating us, nature has created its greatest rival and most beautiful son. Prior to us, there was no creature of earth that dared read from our mother's secret books and learn, to *become* in part, what she is. 

No animal has consumed so much of what nature offers its children. The fruits and wonders of the earth quickly bored our palate. The earth became a claustrophobic prison and we strived to find a *way out*. Looking for a way out... no animal prior to us has looked upon the grand vistas of the earth as a prison... no beast has experienced the madness of such a feeling. Only man can feel shallowness in infinity. 

Unlike the beasts, we have the capacity to understand the boundaries of our existence. We alone can see our life as the solemn march towards oblivion that it is; we alone can possess the knowledge of our death. This is what separates us from the beasts. Man is the animal that can peer into time and see the world turn. No matter what great wonders we stand before, no matter what feats we accomplish, we cannot escape the course nature has set for us. Man carries his prison by knowing his fate.

Our history is written by the madness induced by the sting of death. All great men were driven to *become* something that could not easily be erased by time. No matter if he be a scientist, philosopher, conquerer, artist... every *serious* man, i.e., a man who confronts our fate, has strove to create something beyond himself which could survive his mortal life. Most men use their children to satisfy an aspect of our will to survive, but our children do not pass on our spirit and innate capacities found in ourselves. Each of us has a lineage extending back through billions of years of life; yet, most of our ancestors remain anonymous. To have a silent presence in the future is the best hope most of us have, but such a muted future is unpleasant to the liveliest of men, i.e., those who strive for *greatness*. 

All destructive pursuits of power are extensions of man's desire for self-preservation. If man sounds loud enough on the face of the earth, he reasons, his name will be echoed throughout history. Given that eternity is on the other side of every moment, how can it not be obvious to man that in the long of time Caesar will sound just the same as the name of any ordinary man? The futility of self-preservation in the long of time is the most obvious truth and, to our detriment, also the most ignored truth. Can man be blamed for habitually turning a blind eye to the truth of our fate? Are we not, after all, designed to be chiefly preoccupied with self-preservation above all else? It must be asked now, in a time where man has reached unprecedented levels of destructive power, if our inability to confront our fate is our greatest flaw and most important challenge to overcome: can man finally make peace with oblivion? 

In an age where the faith in God, i.e., faith in eternal preservation, is in decline, one cannot help but forsee a renewed brutality of the old times threatening to consume mankind. When man stands alone in the dark without the light of God, i.e., without hope of preservation, all he feels compelled to do is scream long into the abyss and curse his fate. No spoils of the earth can appease man in such a state because nothing can remove his greatest pain: the shadow of oblivion looms over him. In such times, those with the most power, the freest among us, become the most cursed because they do not have the burdens they have imposed on others: they have gifted away blessings in disguise which keep the underclass from thinking about their fate. The madness of kings shall return and the horror endured by the people will follow. 

The Christians are right about angels and demons: such spirits are among us, but from where do they come? Nature has given us the gift of life along with the debt of death. To some men, the debt exceeds the value of the gift and they see the giver of life, i.e., nature, i.e., God, as a creditor who has imposed a debt without consent. Such men become extensions of death, i.e., demons, i.e., destructive forces bent on consuming life as revenge for the painful and unlawful debt. To other men, the debt is gladly endured for the gift and they cherish the giver of life. Such men become extensions of life, i.e., angels, i.e., life-tending forces that nurture life as a show of gratitude. 

The battle of good versus evil, i.e., angels versus demons, i.e., men who love life versus men who hate life, is the grand tension and story of man. This tension is why our species has risen above the rest: we are the mechanism of the universe that is deciding whether or not life should be preserved or destroyed. Is the gift of life greater than the debt of death? Should the universe be filled with the life born here on earth or should life itself be ended here by our own hand? This is the question put to our species; this is what we are struggling to decide; this is the computation of our lives -- each outcome is well within our reach now. 

## The Case for Life
> There is one mind common to all individual men. Every man is an inlet to the same and to all of the same. He that is once admitted to the right of reason is made a freeman of the whole estate. What Plato has thought, he may think; what a saint has felt, he may feel; what at any time has be-fallen any man, he can understand. Who hath access to this universal mind is a party to all that is or can be done, for this is the only and sovereign agent.
> 
>-Ralph Waldo Emerson, "History" 

We live in a world that is constantly changing. We know that if we leave something in one place, the nature of the universe insists that it will be moved and eventually destroyed, i.e., transformed into something else. For much of human history, this is all man knew of his world and it made him evil, i.e., a force of violent destruction.  

Then, at some point, man discovered *truth*: objects that cannot be destroyed by time. Truths are of a completely different character than the objects man was accustomed to hitherto handling with his hands: such objects can only be held by his mind. Consider a number and how it stands in relation to physical objects. I can have one apple, one horse, one bride, etc. The property of *oneness* describes states of affairs in the world, but also simultaneously remains apart from the world. If you destroy *one* apple, you don't destroy the Idea of *one*: it exists independently of all states of affairs in the world that can be said to have this property. Upon realizing this aspect of truth, man began to equate truth with God; for God has always represented that which cannot be destroyed, i.e., eternity. 

Man is a creature of the universe, i.e., he can be destroyed by time, but he can also unite with objects that cannot be destroyed by time: he has the capacity to know truth. Thus, man is not merely a material object, nor is he an object of eternity: man is the union of the material and the eternal. By knowing truth and using it in the world, man becomes a representation of the eternal in the universe. This is the case for man's divinity and high station in the universe; this is the aspect of man which makes him worthy of preservation and it is also his *sole* means of preservation.   

> Life, the visible world, the phenomenon, is only the mirror of the will. Therefore life accompanies the will as inseparably as the shadow accompanies the body; and if will exists so will life, the world, exist. Life is, therefore, assured to the will to live; and so long as we are filled with the will to live we have no fear of our existence, even in the presence of death. It is true we see the individual come into being and pass away; but the individual is only phenomenal, exists only for the knowledge which is bound to the principle of sufficient reason, to the principio individuationis.  
>
>-Arthur Schopenhauer, "The World as Will and Representation" 

Regardless of your belief in what man calls God, it cannot be denied that truth exists. The case that must be made before man is that truth offers him a path to eternal preservation. Men of God have tried to make this case before man in many ways for thousands of years and it often falls on deaf ears because such a case cannot be made in words. Just as love cannot be experienced by reading descriptions of it, the salvation man finds in the pursuit of truth can only be understood by those who have themselves pursued truth. The pursuit of truth is not merely a fact collecting endeavor, as some institutions may have you believe, it is a journey by which you align yourself to reflect eternal principles which you are uniquely capable of representing. We all have a name in eternity, i.e., truth that is bound to our being, or as Schopenhauer says, we embody the principle of sufficient reason bound to the *principio individuationis*. I therefore would like to offer man an alternative perspective on the sometimes nebulous *faith in God*: have faith in yourself, that you are capable of *being* more than just flesh and blood, that you can be a light that pierces the darkness of the material world, that as a man who is the union of the material and the eternal, it is your destiny to be such a light! 

Similar words are often offered as platitudes and are readily interpreted as such. In this world of burdens, one may look on the prospect of shining as a childish fantasy. One must not interpret what I've said as some promise of being universally loved or used by others. On the contrary, my words mean that if you succeed in finding your name in eternity, you will become your own star, your own source of energy: you will burn for the sake of burning and love yourself as an entity independent of the world. In such a state, the world appears as mere shadows of objects you possess: what use do you, the possessor of the things-in-themselves, have for their convoluted projections in the world? An artist loves creating because that's how he connects with truth. A musician loves composing and performing because that's how he connects with truth. A philosopher philosophizes because that's how he connects with truth.  Each endeavor is a pursuit of truth in their own miraculous way. The ultimate success is a merger of means and ends into a state of being: one sings into the abyss and immensely enjoys the life embodied by the act. 

> 6.54 My propositions are elucidatory in this way:
he who understands me finally recognizes them
as senseless, when he has climbed out through
them, on them, over them. (He must so to speak
throw away the ladder, after he has climbed up
on it.)
>
> He must surmount these propositions; then
he sees the world rightly
>
>-Ludwig Wittgenstein, "Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus"

In my studies I was shocked to find many men across the ages echoing the truths represented by my words in a variety of ways. The question kept begging: why aren't these truths, which amount to the salvation of man, universally held and governing the world? I soon realized that the words of each man was essentially saying "I have found the promise land!", but they did not show said promise land. If you have been to the place they speak of in the space of being, you will know of where they speak and their words will make perfect sense, but if you have not been there, their words are nonsense in the strict sense of the word because you lack the reference to the object of which they are speaking. Wittgenstein even directly addressed this problem in proposition 6.54 of "Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus" where he admits the propositions of that work to be nonsensical. Thus, making the case for life is made difficult, if not impossible for the highly skeptical that are unwilling to be moved by nonsense, by the inadequacy of language in expressing the truths which make the case. The situation is much like when you discarded words of wisdom as a child as nonsense, but later found them to be true because you yourself had discovered the context in which they were useful. 

The case for life is more a matter of art than science. No proposition of science can convince man that life is worth living, or that it has any *value* at all, and certainly no scientist would say it is his business furnish man with such propositions. Thus, as a matter of art, my task has been to present a rendering of life that inspires man to value the gift of his life above the debt of his inevitable death. To restate the rendering of the case made above in short:

> 1.) The gift of life is given with the debt of death. 
> 
> 2.) Man tries to pay for the debt of death by seeking ways of preserving himself. 
> 
> 3.) Man often fails to pay for the debt of death because he cannot be preserved in the material and hence becomes a scornful debtor. 
> 
> 4.) Man becomes evil when he feels that the debt of death is more costly than the gift of life. 
> 
> 5.) Truth alone is eternal. 
> 
> 6.) Man is the union of the material and the eternal.
>  
> 7.) Man can become a representation of truth by pursuing it. 
> 
> 8.) By becoming a representation of truth, man preserves himself by becoming a representation of the eternal.
>  
> 9.) A man preserved in eternity is good because he feels that the gift of life is worth the debt of death. 
> 
> 10.) Therefore, man should seek truth in order to be preserved and say Yes to life.
