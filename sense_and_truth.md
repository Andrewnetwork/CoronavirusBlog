# Sense and Truth - WORK IN PROGRESS

Your phone rings in the middle of the night. You are startled awake and pick up the phone. It's a doctor from your local hospital: **A**="Your son has been injured.", he says. You have no reason to believe the doctor is an impostor or lying and so your emotions begin to swirl as your mind fluctuates over various probability assignments to different types of circumstances which may make **A** true: did he drown, did he fall off his bike, was he attacked by someone, etc.

As seen above, the truth of a proposition alone does not necessarily imply a singular state of affairs. On the contrary, it delimits a *space of affairs*, i.e., the *sense* of the proposition. If the doctor in the phone call above continued to speak and told you that your son's finger was broken by him slamming the fridge door on it while retrieving items for a midnight snack, the *impression* that this *particular* injury would make on you is relative to all other objects contained in the sense of being notified that your son was injured in the middle of the night.

The context of a proposition, naturally, augments its sense. Being notified of your son being injured in the middle of the night has a much *graver* sense than being notified in the middle of the day. Even though they may have a similar *coverage* of objects they contain, i.e., the time of day does not *cause* certain types of injuries, the *probability* of each object making the proposition true is different. It is more likely to be notified in the middle of the night that your son has suffered a heart attack or some domestic injury, as opposed to being notified that he was attacked while walking the streets, which is unusual behavior for most people. 

Therefore, the impression of a truth is relative to the objects covered by the sense of said truth
